Add server stuff for creating a player on connection.

Could combine all game events into one 'gameUpdated' event, which posts the _current_ state of the game
{
  event: 'gameUpdated',
  data: {
    round: 0 (lobby), 1,2,3,4,5
    stage: 'nominate', 'nominationVote' , 'missionVote'
    players: {name, id}[]
    host: playerID
    roundData: {
    }
  }
}

Probably need to use cookies/local storage for user identification rather than IP?
